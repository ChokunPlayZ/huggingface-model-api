# huggingface-model-api
a very simple python app to load huggingface model and host it locally so you get your response instantly! don't have to wait for it to spin up!

required modules:

`datasets` `transformers` `pytorch` `apex` `torchsummary`

## TODO List
- [ ] Load config.json
- [x] load the model so we can use it
- [ ] API Key Authentication (maybe?)
- [ ] add Dockerfile
